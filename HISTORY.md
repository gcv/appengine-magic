## 0.4.9 (2012-03-15)

* Add servlet LocalApiProxy property to container to fix LocalChannelServlet
  and others. (Christoph Mewes)

## 0.4.8 (2012-03-14)

* Added option to use high replication datastore localy. (Christoph Mewes)

## 0.4.7 (2012-02-13)

* Fixed a bug in the application order of `:after-load` hooks (thanks to Shawn
  Lewis).


## 0.4.6 (2011-11-07)

* Basic support for App Engine SDK 1.5.5.
* Added support for `:before-save` and `:after-load` hooks to `defentity`.
* Made an internal change which improves support for interactive REPL use from
  various programming tools. Clojure modes in Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and
  NetBeans should now work. VimClojure, SLIME (swank-clojure), and plain REPL
  (`lein repl`) use should unaffected by this change.
* Support for Clojure 1.3.


## 0.4.5 (2011-09-24)

* Basic support for App Engine SDK 1.5.4.
* Datastore object counts are no longer limited to 1000 (thanks to Justin
  Barton).
* Added support for deleting tasks from task queues.


## 0.4.4 (2011-08-24)

* Basic support for App Engine SDK 1.5.3.
* Various small enhancements.


## 0.4.3 (2011-07-30)

* Basic support for App Engine SDK 1.5.2.
* Added support for reading classpath resources by their internal URLs through
  the `appengine-magic.core/resource-url` function (thanks to Mark Rathwell).


## 0.4.2 (2011-06-21)

* Basic support for App Engine SDK 1.5.1.
* Improved static file Content-Type handling in development mode (thanks to
  Brian Rowe and Tobias Raeder).
* Respect the `APPENGINE_HOME` environment variable if `project.clj` omits
  `:appengine-sdk` (thanks to Dave Lambert).
* Added `appengine-magic.services.channel/parse-presence` to support presence
  notifications from the Channel service.
* Concurrent requests are now enabled by default in all new projects.


## 0.4.1 (2011-04-03)

* Basic support for App Engine SDK 1.4.3.


## 0.4.0 (2011-03-27)

* Added `appengine-magic.services.datastore/key-id`,
  `appengine-magic.services.datastore/key-name`, and
  `appengine-magic.services.datastore/key-kind`.
* Added `appengine-magic.core/appengine-app-id` and
  `appengine-magic.core/appengine-app-version` helper functions.
* **Breaking change:** moved the web application from `resources/` to `war/`. To
  adapt your application to this layout, just rename your application's
  `resources/` directory to `war/`. If you use classpath resources (with the
  `appengine-magic.core/open-resource-stream` function), move them all back to
  `resources/`.
* Added `appengine-magic.services.datastore/key-str`, to get a better handle on
  entity records' IDs.
* **Breaking change:** the result object returned by the `fetch` function of the
  URL Fetch service no longer converts header names to keywords.
* Made it possible to store datastore entities in memcache during interactive
  REPL development.
* Added a hack to allow uploads to the Blobstore service from an application,
  without involving a web browser.
* Modified the Datastore service to optionally support storing values of
  arbitrary readbly-printable Clojure types.
* Added the Images service.
* **Breaking change:** removed `appengine-magic.services.url-fetch/fetch-async`
  function and replaced its functionality with a new `:async?` keyword to
  `appengine-magic.services.url-fetch/fetch`.
* Added the Channel service.
* Made `swank.core/break` work inside Ring handlers (using middleware included
  from Ring).
* Added the ability to directly execute App Engine API calls from the REPL.
* Enabled the use of the administrative console (`/_ah/admin`), including the
  datastore viewer, from the interactive REPL environment (thanks to Yuri
  Niyazov).
* Added two new Leiningen tasks: `appengine-update` and
  `appengine-dev-appserver`. They allow maintaining multiple App Engine
  production environments with different versions (e.g., production and
  staging).
* Added support for new versions of the Google App Engine SDK.


## 0.3.4 (2011-02-23)

* Fixed a bug in use of :prefetch-size and :chunk-size parameters to ds/query.


## 0.3.3 (2011-02-10)

* Improved user service testing support (thanks to Masashi Iizuka).


## 0.3.2 (2010-12-29)

* Added support for VimClojure (thanks to Alex Bolodurin).


## 0.3.1 (2010-11-30)

* Added `as-*` type conversion functions to the Datastore service.
* **Breaking change:** `appengine-magic.services.blobstore/uploaded-blobs` now
  takes a Ring request map parameter (instead of an `HttpServletRequest`). This
  is for consistency with the rest of the services API.
* Added a version of multipart-params middleware which works in App Engine
  (thanks to Conrad Barski).


## 0.3.0 (2010-11-23)

* Added `appengine-magic.core/appengine-environment-type`.
* Deprecated including the `:aot` directive in `project.clj` files.
* Added `exists?` function to the Datastore service.
* Added the Task Queues service.
* Added the Mail service.
* Added the Blobstore service.
* Speeded up production deployment by packaging compiled application .class
  files into a .jar. Eliminated the WEB-INF/classes/ directory.
* Added support for general classpath resources with the
  `appengine-magic.core/open-resource-stream` function.
* **Breaking change:** moved the web application from `resources/war/` to
  `resources/`. This provides better support for using general classpath
  resources.
* Breaking change: renamed all destructive Memcache service operations to have a
  trailing ! character; e.g., `appengine-magic.services/put` became
  `appengine-magic.services/put!`.


## 0.2.1 (2010-10-20)

* Improved the User service.
* Fixed a bug with project paths containing spaces.
* Added the URL Fetch service (thanks to Brian Gruber).
* Added testing infrastructure.
